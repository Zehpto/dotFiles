# dotFiles

Keeping it short and sweet:

1. Download Repo
2. Open terminal, navigate to the directory where the repo was downloaded
3. Copy .vimrc to home directory, type "cp dotFiles/.vimrc ~"
4. Download Vundle: "git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim"
5. Launch VIM (type "vim")
6. When prompted with the vim program, type ":PluginInstall"
7. Vim will download/update all the plugins inside the repo, this can take some time.
8. Enjoy!
